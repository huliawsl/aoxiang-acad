Hi there. I'am Xiang(Axton) Ao (敖翔). I am an enthusiast of computer graphics. Since my first encounter with the fascinating concepts of graphics in junior high school, I have firmly regarded it as the direction for my lifelong efforts. 

At this stage, my research interests mainly focus on the field of 3D generation and stylization.

As an interdisciplinary field of science and art, the exquisite integration of science and art has always been the core of my interest. Currently, I am committed to exploring the integration of deep learning with various aspects of graphics, while closely monitoring the research on the adaptability of graphics technology in the film and television production pipeline.
